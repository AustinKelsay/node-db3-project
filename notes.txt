TK notes:
----------

Foreign keys:
 - So we have already explored the idea of a "primary key"
 - Each table will have its own primary key
 - Foreign keys are just primary keys from other tables brought into your current table as a refference 


Join statements:
 - A join statement is a method for querying data from two or more tables
 - We use it to connect tables on a common field (such as a foreign and primary key)

 SELECT OrderID, CustomerName, OrderDate from Orders
 JOIN Customers
 ON Orders.CustomerId = Customers.CustomerId;
